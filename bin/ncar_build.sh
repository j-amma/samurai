# module purge


# One thing we DO need is to load up the LROSE module, which is currently in Brian's directory, not the system-wide
# ones.  So we need to modify MODULEPATH first.  We should have LROSE modules for Intel 18+, GNU 8+ and PGI 19 (and 20?). 
# You should be able to use whatever compiler is in your current environment, and it'll pick up the right LROSE.
